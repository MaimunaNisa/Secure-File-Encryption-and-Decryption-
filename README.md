# Secure-File-Encryption-and-Decryption-
Secure File Encryption and Decryption is a project designed to protect sensitive data by ensuring secure file storage and transfer. It uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for fast and efficient symmetric encryption of file contents and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) for asymmetric encryption of the AES key, providing an extra layer of security.
